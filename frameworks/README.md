# Frameworks & Code Templates

This folder contains self-developed frameworks, starter projects, and reusable components that I build for learning and experimentation.

Each subfolder represents an independent framework or codebase prototype.  
They may focus on different technologies such as **.NET**, **Thrift**, **Python**, or **web microservices**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure Overview

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `tframework-dotnet/` | A custom framework built on **.NET** and **Apache Thrift**, designed to simplify RPC communication and service scaffolding. |
| *(more coming...)* | Future frameworks or internal development templates will be added here. |

---

## ðŸ§© Purpose
The goal of this directory is to:
- Build reusable, lightweight foundations for future projects  
- Document architecture and design patterns I experiment with  
- Practice modular framework design and interface abstraction  

---

## ðŸš€ Notes
Each framework folder usually includes:
- `src/` â€” source code  
- `docs/` â€” documentation and usage examples  
- `tests/` â€” simple unit or integration tests  
- `README.md` â€” detailed explanation for that specific framework

> Designed for self-learning and rapid prototyping.
