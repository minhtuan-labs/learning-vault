# 🧱 Frameworks

This directory collects my **custom-built frameworks**, utilities, and base components created during learning and experimentation.  
Each subfolder represents a *self-contained development framework* — either a reusable module, a coding architecture experiment, or a prototype for larger systems.

> “Frameworks are distilled experience — learn once, reuse forever.”

---

## 🧩 Purpose

The **Frameworks** section is designed for:
- 🧠 **Understanding software architecture** through hands-on building.
- 🧰 **Reusing base code** for future projects (both personal and research-oriented).
- 🧪 **Experimenting** with new technologies, protocols, and system patterns.

These frameworks are not production-ready by design; they are **research-driven**, focused on clarity, structure, and learning value.

---

## 📂 Structure

```text
frameworks/
├── tframework-dotnet/       # .NET + Thrift based lightweight service framework
├── (future frameworks...)   # Additional experimental frameworks
```

Each subfolder includes its own:
- `README.md` — documentation and setup guide.
- `SampleServer/`, `SampleClient/`, or similar modules.
- Example projects demonstrating usage.

## ⚙️ Development Principles

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Reusability** | Frameworks are written with modular and extensible design in mind. |
| **Clarity over complexity** | Each implementation aims to illustrate architecture concepts simply. |
| **Multi-language approach** | Some frameworks may combine C#, Python, or JavaScript, depending on purpose. |
| **Self-contained demos** | Each folder can run independently for study and testing. |

## 🚀 Examples

### 🔹 [`tframework-dotnet`](tframework-dotnet/)
A lightweight experimental **.NET + Thrift framework** for building distributed services.  
It includes:
- `SampleServer` and `SampleClient` — core examples for RPC communication.
- `P2PChatSystem` — a simple peer-to-peer chat built on top of the framework.

---

## 🧭 Future Additions

Planned future frameworks:
- `py-framework-lite` — Python microservice starter (FastAPI + modular core)
- `ml-utils` — lightweight AI experiment helpers
- `data-pipeline-core` — minimal ETL framework for local data processing
