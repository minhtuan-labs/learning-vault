# oj.vnoi.info — Competitive Programming Practice

This section records my learning journey and solutions from **[VN Online Judge](https://oj.vnoi.info/)**.  
It includes selected problems, explanations, and algorithmic patterns I’ve learned while improving problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms, focusing on:

- Classic algorithms (graph, DP, greedy, divide & conquer)  
- Data structure techniques  
- Complexity analysis and optimization insights
