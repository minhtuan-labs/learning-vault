# 📚 Learning Vault

**Learning Vault** is my personal knowledge repository — a structured collection of everything I study, experiment with, and build.  
It brings together **ebooks, research notes, coding projects, frameworks, and algorithm practice**, forming a long-term record of continuous learning and experimentation.

> “Document what you learn. Build what you imagine.”

## 🧭 Overview

This repository serves as a *central hub* for my learning journey in:
- 💡 **Software Development** (Python, .NET, AI frameworks)
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & AI**
- ⚙️ **System Design and Architecture**
- 📊 **Data Science and Engineering Practices**
- 🧩 **Algorithmic Problem Solving**
- 🧱 **Personal Frameworks and Tools**

It connects directly to my personal site:

### 🔹 **Projects**
Self-built experimental projects combining code, AI, and research ideas.  
Each project folder includes its own README and setup guide.

### 🔹 **Frameworks**
Custom-built frameworks or utilities for software development and learning.  
Example: [`tframework-dotnet`](frameworks/tframework-dotnet) — a .NET + Thrift communication framework.

### 🔹 **Research Notes**
Summaries, key concepts, and personal interpretations of research papers, articles, and technical books.

### 🔹 **Ebooks**
Curated reading list covering AI, computer science, data engineering, and software craftsmanship.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repository follows a simple principle:
> “Learn deeply. Build practically. Share openly.”

Every folder represents **a self-contained learning domain** —  
you can navigate, clone, or explore each part independently.

---

## 🚀 How to Explore

You can browse each folder directly on GitHub, or clone the repo locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhtuan-labs/learning-vault.git
cd learning-vault
```

Each subdirectory (especially under `projects/` or `frameworks/`) contains its own `README.md` with details, setup, and context.
