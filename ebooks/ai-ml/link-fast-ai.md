Notes: “Excellent for practitioners — builds intuition through code-first learning.”

## 💬 Personal Notes
- The first few chapters provide an intuitive overview of transfer learning.  
- I like how it encourages starting with pre-trained models immediately.  
- Useful complement to *Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al.)* and *ISLP (Python)* for a balanced theory + practice mix.
